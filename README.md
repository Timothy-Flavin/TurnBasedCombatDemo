# TurnBasedCombatDemo:
short turn based rpg game demo made in a couple weeks when I was first starting out programming in 2016.
it was a final project in my intro to java class as a Jr in highschool
# how to run:
must run via command line
1. cd to the `GameTest` folder
2. `javac *.java` to compile
3. `java GameDriver` to run
4. enjoy my first attempt at a game system from years ago
5. bat squirrels will make a return in future games
